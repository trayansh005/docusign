## 📊 Key Findings

### Current State

```
Page Load Time:     1.2-1.5 seconds ❌
API Calls:          4-5 sequential ❌
Database Queries:   18 per load ❌
Payload Size:       100-150KB ❌
Largest Item:       Inbox response (50-100KB) ❌
```

### Target State (After All Optimizations)

```
Page Load Time:     0.2-0.3 seconds ✅
API Calls:          1-2 parallel ✅
Database Queries:   1-2 per load ✅
Payload Size:       10-20KB ✅
Improvement:        80% faster, 85% smaller ✅
```

### Root Causes

**Primary Issue:** 9 separate database count queries

- **Impact:** +250ms latency, wasteful database load
- **Example:** Count total, pending, completed = 3 queries each for owner + assigned
- **Solution:** Use MongoDB aggregation pipeline (1 query gets all counts)

**Secondary Issue:** Large inbox payload fetching all documents

- **Impact:** 50-100KB transferred, only 10% visible
- **Example:** User can see 3-5 items but backend sends 50+
- **Solution:** Add pagination (10 items per page)

**Tertiary Issue:** Sequential API calls instead of parallel

- **Impact:** +400-600ms wasted waiting
- **Example:** Call 1 finishes at 200ms, Call 2 at 500ms, Call 3 at 900ms (sequential) vs 400ms (parallel)
- **Solution:** Use Promise.all() for parallel execution
