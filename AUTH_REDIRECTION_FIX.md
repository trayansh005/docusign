# Authentication Redirection Fix - Summary

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Middleware Only Works on Initial Load**

The Next.js middleware (`middleware.ts`) only checks authentication when:

- A user first navigates to a protected route from outside the app
- The page is initially loaded

**Problem:** If a user is already on `/dashboard` and their session expires, they won't be redirected to login automatically.

### 2. **Protected Pages Had No Client-Side Auth Guards**

Protected pages (`/dashboard`, `/profile`, `/fomiqsign/**`) were:

- Relying solely on server-side middleware
- NOT checking `isAuthenticated` state after mount
- NOT redirecting if a user's auth state changed

**Result:** Users wouldn't be redirected until they manually refreshed the page.

---

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Added Client-Side Auth Guards to Protected Pages

#### 1. **Profile Page** (`d:\DocuSign Site\frontend\src\app\profile\page.tsx`)

```tsx
// Auth guard - redirect to login if not authenticated
useEffect(() => {
	if (!isLoading && !isAuthenticated) {
		router.replace("/login");
	}
}, [isAuthenticated, isLoading, router]);
```

#### 2. **Dashboard Page** (`d:\DocuSign Site\frontend\src\app\dashboard\DashboardClient.tsx`)

- Added import: `import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"`
- Added auth context access: `const { user, isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuth()`
- Added auth guard that redirects if `!isAuthenticated` after `!isLoading`

#### 3. **FomiqSign Dashboard** (`d:\DocuSign Site\frontend\src\components\FomiqDashboard\DashboardClient.tsx`)

- Added imports: `useRouter` and `useAuth`
- Added auth guard before any component rendering
- Ensures users accessing document signing are authenticated

## How It Works

### **Flow Diagram:**

```
User visits protected page
        ↓
Middleware checks (first-request level)
        ↓
Page component mounts
        ↓
useEffect checks isAuthenticated (client-side)
        ↓
If NOT authenticated:
  - Calls router.replace("/login")
  - User redirected immediately (no refresh needed)
        ↓
If authenticated:
  - Page renders normally
  - Auth context keeps monitoring
```

### **Key Points:**

1. **Middleware Check:**

   - Runs on server-side, first request only
   - Catches direct navigation to protected routes (e.g., direct URL entry)
   - Redirect happens before page loads

2. **Client-Side Guard (NEW):**

   - Runs after component mounts
   - Monitors `isAuthenticated` state from `AuthContext`
   - Catches session expiration or logout events
   - `router.replace()` doesn't create browser history entry

3. **Why `useEffect` Instead of Direct Check:**
   - `isLoading` prevents redirect flash during initial auth check
   - Waits for auth context to finish initializing
   - Only redirects when certainty exists about auth state

---

## Testing Guide

### Scenario 1: Direct Navigation (Middleware Test)

```
1. Logout completely
2. Manually navigate to /dashboard
3. Expected: Redirect to /login (middleware catches this)
```

### Scenario 2: Session Expiration (Client-Side Guard Test)

```
1. Login and go to /dashboard
2. Delete auth cookies in DevTools (Application → Cookies)
3. Or wait for token to expire (test with short token expiry)
4. Expected: Automatic redirect to /login (no refresh needed)
```

### Scenario 3: Subscription Update (Already Fixed)

```
1. Login and subscribe
2. Success modal appears
3. Expected: "Current plan" button shows immediately (not "Subscribe")
```

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `frontend/src/app/profile/page.tsx`                          | Added auth guard          | Profile page now redirects if logged out        |
| `frontend/src/app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`             | Added import + auth guard | Dashboard redirects if session expires          |
| `frontend/src/components/FomiqDashboard/DashboardClient.tsx` | Added import + auth guard | Document signing redirects if not authenticated |

---

## Why This Fixes the Issue

### **Before:**

```
User logged out → Stays on /dashboard → Sees stale data → Manual refresh required
```

### **After:**

```
User logged out → useEffect detects isAuthenticated=false → router.replace("/login") → Redirected immediately
```

## Related: Earlier Subscription Fix

On the same session, fixed subscription modal not updating state:

- **File:** `frontend/src/app/subscription/page.tsx`
- **Issue:** Success modal shown but button didn't update without refresh
- **Fix:** Added immediate state update with subscription data after verification

---

## Future Improvements (Optional)

1. **Add error boundary** around protected pages to catch auth errors
2. **Implement timeout warning** before session expires
3. **Add "Session expired, redirecting..." toast notification**
4. **Centralize auth guards** in a custom hook: `useProtectedRoute()`

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Added auth guards to all protected pages
- [x] Guards use both `isLoading` and `isAuthenticated` checks
- [x] All imports are correct and no compilation errors
- [x] `router.replace()` used instead of `router.push()` for clean redirect
- [x] Subscription update also fixes the modal/state issue
