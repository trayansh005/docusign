## üîß Implementation Tools & Commands

### For Database Indexes

```bash
# In MongoDB shell
db.docusigntemplates.createIndex({ createdBy: 1, isArchived: 1 })
db.docusigntemplates.createIndex({ createdBy: 1, status: 1, isArchived: 1 })
```

### For Performance Testing

```bash
# Chrome DevTools Network tab
# Ctrl+Shift+K ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Reload page
# Check: Total time, payload size, # of requests

# Or use curl with timing
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:5000/api/dashboard/stats
```

### For Database Query Analysis

```javascript
// In MongoDB shell - analyze query performance
db.docusigntemplates.find({createdBy: ObjectId(...)}).explain("executionStats")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### Don't Skip These Steps

1. ‚ùå Don't skip database index creation (critical for Phase 1)
2. ‚ùå Don't deploy without testing pagination edge cases
3. ‚ùå Don't remove old endpoints immediately (keep 2+ weeks)
4. ‚ùå Don't skip performance monitoring setup
5. ‚ùå Don't merge without code review

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå Creating too many indexes (impacts writes)
2. ‚ùå Pagination limit too low (too many requests)
3. ‚ùå Breaking API contracts without migration plan
4. ‚ùå Testing only happy path (test edge cases)
5. ‚ùå Skipping rollback procedure

---

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Phase 1 Rollback (Easy)

- Revert indexes: `db.docusigntemplates.dropIndex(indexName)`
- Revert API calls: Switch back to sequential useEffect
- No data impact

### Phase 2 Rollback (Moderate)

- Keep old endpoints for 2 weeks
- Switch frontend to old endpoints if needed
- Keep new data structures (safe to keep)

### Phase 3 Rollback (Complex)

- Remove caching layer (switch to direct DB)
- Migrate data back if needed
- Requires coordination with DevOps

---

## üìû Support & FAQ

### Q: What's the risk of these changes?

**A:** Phase 1 is low risk (easy to rollback). Phase 2 is medium (keeps old endpoints). Phase 3 is higher but optional.

### Q: Can I do this incrementally?

**A:** Yes! Do Phase 1 first (40% improvement), then Phase 2 (additional 40%), Phase 3 is optional.

### Q: Do I need to restart the server?

**A:** After Phase 1 database changes: yes. After code changes: usually yes for backend, maybe for frontend.

### Q: How long will implementation take?

**A:** Phase 1: ~90 min, Phase 2: ~150 min, Phase 3: ~240 min. Total: 4-6 hours.

### Q: What if something breaks?

**A:** Follow the rollback procedures in the implementation guide. Keep old endpoints available for immediate rollback.
